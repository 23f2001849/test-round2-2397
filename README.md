## Technical Details
- **HTML5**: Used for creating the structure of the web page.

## Code Explanation
The web page consists of a simple HTML structure with a head and body section. The head section contains the meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, and the title of the document. The CSS styles are also included in the head section within style tags. The body section contains the h1#title element which displays the text 'Version 1.0'.

The CSS code changes the color of the h1#title element to red. This is achieved by using the id selector (#) followed by the id name (title) to select the h1 element with the id 'title', and setting its color property to red.
