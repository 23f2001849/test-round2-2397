# Project Title: Version Display

## Overview
Following the successful completion of the first version of the Version Display application, we now present to you Version 2.0. This version introduces some modifications in line with the project brief. The web application still maintains its simplicity, while also demonstrating the dynamic nature of web development.

The Version 2.0 update introduces a subtitle and changes the color of the title, providing a visual indication of the update. The purpose of these changes is to demonstrate how simple it is to update and maintain web applications, even after they have been deployed. Like the previous version, this application can be viewed on various devices due to its responsive design. This application, though simple, provides a foundation upon which more complex and dynamic web applications can be built.

## Features
- Updated HTML structure: The application now includes a subtitle, h2#subtitle, with the text 'Updated Successfully'.
- Updated CSS Styling: The h1#title element color has been changed from red to blue and now displays 'Version 2.0'.

## Setup Instructions
To run the application, follow these steps:
1. Open your preferred web browser.
2. Open the index.html file in the browser. This can usually be done by going to 'File > Open File' in the browser menu, then selecting the index.html file.

## Usage Guide
The application is straightforward to use. Upon opening the index.html file in a web browser, you will see the text 'Version 2.0' displayed in blue. Below it, you will see a subtitle that says 'Updated Successfully'.

## Technical Details
This project was created using HTML and CSS. HTML was used to structure the content of the web page, while CSS was used to style the HTML elements. The project is designed with a responsive layout, making it compatible with various devices and screen sizes.

## Code Explanation
The application consists of a basic HTML structure with a head and body section. The head section contains style tags that define the CSS for the page. The body section contains the h1 and h2 elements that display the title and subtitle.

In the CSS, the color of the h1#title element was changed from red to blue, and the text was changed to 'Version 2.0'. A new h2#subtitle element was also added, with the text 'Updated Successfully'.

## Round 2 Note
In this version, the h1#title element's color was changed from red to blue, and the text was updated to 'Version 2.0'. A new h2#subtitle element was also introduced, with the text 'Updated Successfully'. These changes were made to demonstrate the ease of updating a web application.
